# MyDabloons-Gameplay-Prototype
This is the GitHub repository that will track the development of the gameplay prototype for the card game implementation of the game concept "My Dabloons!" Currently, the game is being developed as the final project for Manhattan College's COMM 365 - Game Design and Development course. This game is in early alpha.

## VERSION a1.0.1

### FEATURES:
    - Deck of cards
    - Main gameplay loop
    - Option to end game every 10 turns
    
### So why Python?
Python was chosen simply because it is a language that I am currently learning this semester as a Computer Science elective course for my undergraduate degree. This prototype is also not meant to be directly translated into another digital format at this time, so choosing another language that I know such as C++ or Java was not put into consideration.
